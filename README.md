# odin-etch-a-sketch

Continue practice with DOM manipulation skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

With this project, the goal is to illustrate my understanding of manipulating DOM elements to add event listeners to elements as they are added inside a container by creating a Etch-A-Sketch. I was also able to combine my DOM manipulation skills with my Flexbox skills to obtain the grid needed for the project.

I obtained a color scheme for the user interface by using a random color generator and used white for the actual Etch-A-Sketch board. I used CSS to change the appearance during hovering while making sure the padding remained the same to keep the content from moving.

I was able to get the project to change the background color of each grid element to black after a mouse hover. I was also able to add a prompt that allows the user to change the grid to a size less than 101x101 and greater than 0x0. For bonus, I decided to add buttons that allow the user to draw in rainbow (randomized RGB coloring) or use shading.
